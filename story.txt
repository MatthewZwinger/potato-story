Once there was an ugly potato, he was so ugly that everyone died.

He lived in a land filled with other, more attractive potatoes.
These potatoes sustained themselves on the beauty of those around them.
When the ugly potato was born, a problem arose.

All of a sudden, every potato in the land keeled over from a seering pain
in their eyes. They died within seconds, and the baby potato was all alone.
Luckily, a family of beets happened to pass by the room where the ugly
potato was born, and they took him in as one of their own.

As was expected, ugly potato started to live a wonderful life with this 
family of beets. While beets all treatd this ugly potato as one of them with
no discrimination at all, this potato, however, made its move...

The end
