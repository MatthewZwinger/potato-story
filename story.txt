Once there was an ugly potato, he was so ugly that everyone died.

He lived in a land filled with other, more attractive potatoes.
These potatoes sustained themselves on the beauty of those around them.
When the ugly potato was born, a problem arose.

All of a sudden, every potato in the land keeled over from a seering pain
in their eyes. They died within seconds, and the baby potato was all alone.
Luckily, a family of beets happened to pass by the room where the ugly
potato was born, and they took him in as one of their own.
